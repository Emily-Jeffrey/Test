🫣 What do you think is the future of Gowanus in Brooklyn? NYC’s most polluted canal is undergoing a massive transformation, with high-rise residential construction. But will it be a pleasant place to live? The Gowanus Canal Conservancy is ensuring that the transformation has a positive impact on the environment and the community. #nyclife #brooklyn
Most of the gentrified and luxury developed areas of Brooklyn are some of the most toxic. The largest property in Williamsburg was owned by the Sanitation Dept 😞🤫
Gowanus glows in the dark. All those transplants moving into the new condos will not be happy in 20 years when they are glowing in the dark too.
The city only cares about the environment in these neighborhoods when the minorities are forced out of the area. All these years the river has remained polluted/neglected but now because there are rich white people moving there, it matters…
Brooklyn Native here: The canal is still dirty and its smells like rotten eggs in the summer and they pulled a dead body out of the canal last year, but the gentrifiers love building luxury buildings by waterways even if it’s toxic & dirty 🤷🏽‍♀️
Ima tell yall RN. To everyone coming to this neighborhood, renting $3000+apts on the gowanus, as a native, THIS IS THE DUMBEST place to live. It stinks 24/7. It floods everytime it rains. Oh and its TOXIC. Yall gentrified my neighborhood to live on trash.
Forgot to mentioned the bodies dumped in there as well. Gowanas didn’t get this amount of attention until people with Money moved in after 2000.
It took high rises and greedy developers for people to invest in the gowanus clean up. happy we got here but at what cost?
They calling it Venice of Brooklyn lmao Natural habitat for the Coney Island Whitefish. 🤢 My iPhone 4s is decaying at the bottom of the canal. It’s been there since 2014 🥀🥀 The smell is yikes 😖😩 Alot of it from 2 cycle engines, oil mixed with gas. My father ran the crane on the dock for Cerified Concrete during the 70’s and 80’s in Newtown Creek. Help I thought this was rocks Discowater. Lavender Lake lives Went to a gallery opening years ago that was all trippy photos of the pollution on the canal. I didn't tell my friends I brought along what they were photos of and they thought it all looked so beautiful until they found out. The most polluted waterway on the eastern seaboard And the governor says I can’t have a gas stove I grew up there, it’s very polluted and God knows what’s in there. They have been cleaning it up for many years so I don’t know, but it smells better than it used to. I lived just blocks away for 20 years. No I wouldn't want to live right next to that chemical death trap. Mob graveyard ?? There is no bigger mafia than the US government.. and I think they even did worse Not to mention that chlamydia causing bacteria was found in the canal in 2018 and gonorrhea in 2007 but no longer was there proof of cholera 😱 Have a drink at two times and then be put into the drink ha😂 Old Nayb - poison water / maybe a dragged clean up with fresh solar water flowing through ? I swam in it one drunken night the hipsters lazy river I watch them pull up many skeletons outta there....best place to drop anything... I saw a jellyfish in there a long time ago, Just swimming with the trash. That was a mutant bro, not a jellyfish CEMENT BOOTS WHERE THE THING, I LIVE 100 FEET FROM IT. the mosquitoes in Gowanus are enough to keep me away let alone the flooding Copenhagen comps aside, it’s wonderful they’re going to try to clean it up, even if it’s just for commercial gain. The cleanup will help the visiting and residing birds and other wildlife Weren’t the people working at Royal Palms getting sick bc of the canal fumes? I have a poster in my living room that says CREATURES OF THE GOWANUS CANAL with a bunch of cute little creatures on it. Anyway, I love Gowanus gowanus is literally just whole foods and GGs fish and chips town for me You can swim in the gowanus if you are pure of heart At least the people moving here can afford those medical bills from the health complications. poonami is killing me The delulu is deluluing for developers. Eh the parks offend me less than the buildings themselves, which are truly soulless 100%, corporate architects suck And that smell can be all yours every day for the low price of $4,800 a month The best pickles I have ever had in my life are from this location. Not sure I’d want to eat the vegetables grown on the roof  if you visit there in the spring, you are bound to see a body float up as the water warms It is absolutely incredible that there are these giant expensive condos being built there and it’s a toxic river. $2.5m for a studio apartment next to toxic site that has cancer causing chemicals. 🔥 It’s very cute love the fridge on the sidewalk to take and give food The Seine-ification of the gowanus canal I feel like I’d come out of the water with a shark fin and a third nipple if I swam in the canal 💀
